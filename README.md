 Problem:
Credit card fraud detection. It is important that credit card companies can recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders and presents transactions that occurred over two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

We have 31 columns. Due to confidentiality issues, we know nothing about the original features or any background information about the data. The feature ‘Time’ contains the seconds elapsed between a transaction and the start of the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction amount. Features V1 – V28 are the principle components obtained with Principle Component Analysis. Feature 'Class' is the response variable where the positive class is “fraudulent” and “non-fraudulent” otherwise.
